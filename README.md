# Metal Data Science

This repository presents a data science project using large-scale data on heavy metal bands.  
It serves as a technical showcase demonstrating analytical and modeling techniques applied to heterogeneous real-world data.

## Project Overview

The project explores structured and semi-structured band data to demonstrate a range of data science methodologies, including:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Network analysis
- Clustering and modeling techniques
- Data visualization

## Data Source

The analyses are based on band metadata sourced from [Encyclopaedia Metallum (Metal Archives)](https://www.metal-archives.com/).

The data were extracted for research and educational purposes.  
The original dataset is not redistributed. Only derived or aggregated data may be included in this repository.
